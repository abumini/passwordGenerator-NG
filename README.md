# Password Generator with history

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.
This is a simple password generator with a strength from 0 to 4, no security package was used for since this is only meant for development purposes.

I do not provide any support to this project, but feel free to fork it and play with it and make it even better. Cheers!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
